1. [Description]

	This program runs four algorithms (in order):
		1. Optimal Binary Search Tree
		2. Greedy Binary Search Tree
		3. Stable Marriage

	For algorithms 1 and 2, the file "data_A4_Q2.txt" will be used.

2.	[Build/Compiling]

	To build, first extract all files from the tar.

	Once all files have been extracted, ensure that all files
	all present:

root
----a4.h
----main.c
----P11.c
----P12.c
----P2.c
----makefile
----readme
----data_A4_Q1.txt

The readme and design files are just text files.

	The a4 executable can now be created by executing the

		make

	command. This will compile all .c files using the following flags:

		-std=c99 
		-lm

	The -lm flag is needed to locate the math.h library.

	The executable, named a4, should now be created in the current 
	directory. It can also be removed by executing the 

		make clean

	command. 

3.	[Testing]

	To run the program, check that the executable a4 is within the
	current directory and execute
	
		./a4

	The program will begin by asking for the file to use for P2.
	
	Then program will then begin to run each of the three algorithms.
